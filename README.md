### Abstract:
- This is a simple Command Line game of rock, paper, scissors built in Python. With infinite replayability and session stat-tracking, just start the game, make your strategic choice against the computer, and hope you win!

### Installation Instructions:
- First you’ll want to check that you have Python installed on your machine by opening your terminal and running either `python --version` or `python3 --version`. If you don’t have it, you can get the official download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Next you'll clone this repository to your machine<br>`cd` into the directory and run either<br>`python -u main.py` or `python3 -u main.py` to start the game.

### Context:
- As a first foray into Python, I wanted to make this little game just to get experience with the language, syntax, and workflows.
- This project didn’t take very long; 2-3 hours at most, but it definitely helped to get some hands-on work with Python instead of just tutorials and documentation.
